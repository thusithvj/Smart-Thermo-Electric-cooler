# Smart-Thermo-Electric-cooler
Built a smart thermoelectric cooler that can precisely control and maintain temperature — all without relying on a traditional refrigeration cycle.

🔹 Project Highlights:
 - Designed a compact system that can achieve and maintain any target temperature with ±1°C accuracy
 - Used a Peltier module with CPU-grade fans for efficient thermoelectric cooling
 - Built a custom insulated enclosure using precisely laser-cut Rigifoam to ensure minimal heat exchange
 - Developed our own temperature sensor from scratch, alongside an LM35 to monitor ambient temperature
 - Added a magnetic door sensor that alerts the user if the cooler door is left open or not sealed properly — crucial for temperature stability

🔹 Control System:
 - Used a NI USB-6001 DAQ card to interface with sensors and control outputs
 - Programmed the system using LabVIEW, where we created a real-time closed-loop feedback system
 - LabVIEW provided live data visualization, adjustable setpoints, and control logic to dynamically regulate the Peltier’s power
 - The DAQ card handled analog inputs (temperature sensors) and digital outputs (for driving actuators and the alert system)
