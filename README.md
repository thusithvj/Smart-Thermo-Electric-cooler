# Smart-Thermo-Electric-cooler
Built a smart thermoelectric cooler that can precisely control and maintain temperature â€” all without relying on a traditional refrigeration cycle.

ðŸ”¹ Project Highlights:
 â€¢ Designed a compact system that can achieve and maintain any target temperature with Â±1Â°C accuracy
 â€¢ Used a Peltier module with CPU-grade fans for efficient thermoelectric cooling
 â€¢ Built a custom insulated enclosure using precisely laser-cut Rigifoam to ensure minimal heat exchange
 â€¢ Developed our own temperature sensor from scratch, alongside an LM35 to monitor ambient temperature
 â€¢ Added a magnetic door sensor that alerts the user if the cooler door is left open or not sealed properly â€” crucial for temperature stability

ðŸ”¹ Control System:
 â€¢ Used a NI USB-6001 DAQ card to interface with sensors and control outputs
 â€¢ Programmed the system using LabVIEW, where we created a real-time closed-loop feedback system
 â€¢ LabVIEW provided live data visualization, adjustable setpoints, and control logic to dynamically regulate the Peltierâ€™s power
 â€¢ The DAQ card handled analog inputs (temperature sensors) and digital outputs (for driving actuators and the alert system)

ðŸ”¹ Key Learnings:
 â€¢ Gained hands-on experience in sensor design, feedback control, and thermal system integration
 â€¢ Applied instrumentation techniques to real-world engineering problems
 â€¢ Learned how to work with LabVIEW and NI hardware to create responsive, real-time systems
